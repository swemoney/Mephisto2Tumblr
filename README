Mephisto2Tumblr
Revision: 1

Requires: rubygems, active_record
Optional: RedCloth
Tested with: Ruby 1.8.7, Mephisto database 0.8.2

Mephisto2Tumblr will take an old Mephisto database, extract the articles and upload them to 
a Tumblr account. It uses the database by itself so you don't need a functional Mephisto 
instance running. If you have the RedCloth gem installed, it will take care of converting 
your Textile formatted posts (which are not supported by Tumblr) into HTML. Excerpts are 
also converted over to Tumblr format.

Very simple to use. Open up the script in your favorite text editor and plug in all the 
information needed at the top of the script. Then..

$ chmod +x m2t.rb
$ ./m2t.rb

You'll see it doing it's thing and when it's finally done, it will generate a file with 
rewrite rules in it if you would like to forward the links from your old blog to the 
new one.

You are free to edit and distribute this script to your hearts content. A quick "credit" 
would be great if you intend on redistributing.
